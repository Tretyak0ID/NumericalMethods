# NumericalMethods

This repository is designed to store the database of used scripts of numerical methods, originally created as part of an educational course.

### The base includes:
* Basic algorithms for numerical methods of analysis and linear algebra written at NRU MIET in MATLAB.
* Modeling of ordinary differential equations and equations of mathematical physics performed at NRU MIET in MATLAB.
